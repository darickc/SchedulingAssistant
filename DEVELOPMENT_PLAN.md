## Notes

### Design Decisions
- **SQLite over Realm**: Simpler, no sync needed, smaller bundle
- **Expo over React Native CLI**: Faster development, easier deployment
- **Local storage only**: Privacy, no server costs, offline-first
- **Google Calendar direct**: No backend needed, real-time updates

### Known Limitations
- Cannot receive SMS responses automatically
- Requires manual confirmation of appointments
- Limited to Google Calendar (for now)
- No web version (mobile only)

### Security Considerations
- Google tokens stored securely in Keychain/Keystore
- No sensitive data in AsyncStorage
- SQLite database encrypted on device
- No data transmission to external servers
